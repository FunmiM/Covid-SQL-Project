COVID-19 Data Exploration & Dashboard
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project explores global COVID-19 data using SQL for data cleaning, analysis, and insights generation. Key findings were visualized through an interactive Power BI dashboard to highlight trends in cases, deaths, infection rates, and vaccinations across countries and continents.

ðŸ“Š Dataset

The dataset contains global COVID-19 statistics including:

* Confirmed cases
* Deaths
* Population data
* Vaccinations

Data source:(https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths)

ðŸ›  Skills & Tools Used

* SQL: Joins, Aggregations, CTEs, Temp Tables, Views, Window Functions
* Power BI: Data modeling, visualization, dashboard creation
* Data Analysis: Trend analysis, percentage calculations, comparative insights

ðŸ”Ž SQL Analysis Highlights



* Cases vs. Deaths: Calculated death percentages across countries.
* Cases vs. Population: Determined infection rates by population.
* Highest Infection & Death Rates: Identified countries and continents with the largest impact.
* Vaccination Analysis: Tracked vaccination progress using rolling sums, CTEs, and temp tables.
* Global Trends: Aggregated global cases, deaths, and death percentages.

ðŸ“ˆ Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard presents:

* Total Death per Continent
* Percentage Population Infected
* Country-level breakdowns

âœ… Key Insights

* Countries with the highest population did not always have the highest infection rates.
* Vaccination rates varied significantly across regions, influencing case and death trends.
* Death percentages highlighted the severity of outbreaks in certain countries despite lower overall case numbers.

ðŸ“‚ How to Use

1. Run the SQL scripts provided in the repository to reproduce the analysis.
2. Open the Power BI file to explore the interactive dashboard.
Would you like me to also make a **shorter version** (like a 1-minute read) alongside this, so you can decide whether to keep the extensive one or go lighter depending on your GitHub style?
